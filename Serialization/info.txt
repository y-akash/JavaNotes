Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes 
which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. 
The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. 

A java object is serializable if its class or any of its subclasses implements java.io.Serializable or 
its subinterface java.io.Externalizable interface. 

The entire process is JVM independent, meaning an object can be serialized on one platform and 
deserialized on an entirely different platform. 

Classes ObjectinputStream and ObjectOutputStream are high-level streams 
that contain the methods for serializing and deserializing an object.
