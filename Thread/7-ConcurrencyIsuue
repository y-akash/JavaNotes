Race Condition
    Sometimes multiple threads try to modify the same data at same time they may get wrong result or 
    application can be crashed such scenerio is called race condition where multiple treads are racing to modify the same data
Visibility problem
    if one thread changes the data and this change is not visible to another thread such scenerio is called Visibility problem


so to overcome this we use Thread-safe code
